	<h1>MEET NIVEEN!</h1>
	<h2>The first born.</h2>

	<p>This is my daughter, Niveen who is 16 years old and if she saw this would completely lose her mind.</p>

	<p>I truly believe that my job as a mother is to embarass the shit out of her every chance I get so how could I talk about anything else for this project?</p>

	<p>In all seriousness though, I am extremely proud of this human being.  She gets straight A's, breaks track records, and is an empathetic lovely person who cares for her family and friends very much. She is also an amazing musician in progress and you can see her in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBlQjlh34Iw" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
	
	<p>So enough of that and back to my mission, please enjoy this video from when she was 5 years old.</p>
